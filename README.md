# Rock-paper-scissor 
A simple Rock paper scissor game based on javascript. 
This game can be played from your browser console.
The winner of the match will be decided based on the best 0f five-rounds.
Pick you throw by hovering over any one of the buttons and click it.
There is a 'Restart' button below which you can use to restart the match in the middle of the game and that can also be used as a "play-Again" button after the end of a match. 
**Cheers**
